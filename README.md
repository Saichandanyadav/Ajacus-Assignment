# Chandan Ajacus Dashboard

## Overview
The User Management Dashboard is a simple web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details, interfacing with a mock backend API provided by JSONPlaceholder. The application allows users to manage a list of users with fields such as ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Department.

## Features
- **View Users**: Displays a list of users fetched from the `/users` endpoint of JSONPlaceholder.
- **Add Users**: Allows adding new users via a form, which simulates a successful addition to the backend.
- **Edit Users**: Fetches current data of an existing user, allows editing, and updates the user on the backend.
- **Delete Users**: Deletes a selected user from the list by sending a delete request to the API.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages when API requests fail.
- **Responsive Interface**: The application is designed to be mobile-friendly with a responsive layout.

### Bonus (Optional)
- **Pagination/Infinite Scrolling**: The list of users can be paginated or support infinite scrolling.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Input validation has been implemented on the form fields.
  
## Tools & Technologies
- **JavaScript**: Used to build the functionality.
- **React (Optional)**: React can be used to manage the state of the application and render components.
- **Axios or Fetch API**: Used for making API requests to JSONPlaceholder.
- **JSONPlaceholder API**: A mock API used to simulate backend requests for user management.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface, ensuring responsiveness.

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-management-dashboard.git
cd user-management-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
If using Node.js (with React or any other front-end framework):
```bash
npm install
```
Otherwise, ensure the necessary dependencies like Axios (or Fetch) are included in your project.

### 3. Run the Application
To start the development server, use the following command (for React projects):
```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Open the Application
Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the relevant port in your project) in your browser.

## Usage
- Upon launching, the application will display a list of users retrieved from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- You can add a new user by clicking the "Add" button, filling in the user details, and submitting the form.
- Existing users can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button next to their name, modifying their details, and saving the changes.
- Users can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button next to their name.

## Error Handling
If an API request fails (e.g., network error, or JSONPlaceholder is unavailable), the application will display an error message. Ensure you handle errors gracefully to improve the user experience.

## Reflection & Challenges
During the development of this project:
- I focused on creating a modular and scalable application that can handle basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- One challenge faced was handling the mock nature of JSONPlaceholder API, which doesn't persist data. Therefore, changes like adding or deleting users only simulate success.
- If given more time, I would implement more robust error handling, improve the form validation, and integrate real backend API for persistent user data.

## Improvements (Optional)
- Add user authentication for managing user sessions.
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large data sets efficiently.
- Integrate a real database and backend server to persist user data.
